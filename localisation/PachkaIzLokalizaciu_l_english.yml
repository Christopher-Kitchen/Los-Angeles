The police are not coping with their tasks, the authorities are powerless in the current situation.

 to_vag_and_act:0 "Agents of the Aztecas and Vagos"
 FYB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Front Yard Ballas control the districts of Idlewood and southern East Los Santos. Since Idlewood was originally under Grove Street Families control, it is unlikey they were the original Ballas set, but rose to prominence after taking Idlewood from the Grove Street Families during the early-to-mid–1980s. Front Yard Ballas are the largest and most powerful of the four sets of Ballas."
 GSF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Grove Street Families is an African-American street gang and one of the oldest street gangs in Los Santos. They are the sworn enemy of the Ballas, an intense and ongoing rivalry as part of the Ballas-Grove Street War. The Families also maintain rivalries with the two Mexican gangs in Los Santos - the Los Santos Vagos and the Varrios Los Aztecas. Their rivalry with the Varrios Los Aztecas is not nearly as intense as it is with the Ballas and Vagos. However, both gangs will still commonly fight. Kendl (sister of Grove Street Leader Sweet) ends up dating a high-ranking member of the Aztecas while CJ befriends him - much to the disapproval of Sweet."
 LSV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The history of the Vagos is shrouded in mystery, as well as many of the events surrounding the gang, though they probably started forming simultaneously in relation to the other Los Santos gangs during the 1970s and 1980s. The Vagos are based in the eastern and northeastern neighborhoods of Los Santos, which are historically majority-populated by the Chicano (Mexican-American) community. Prior to 1992, they also controlled northern East Los Santos. This is evidenced by CJ's reaction to OG Loc directing CJ to northern East Los Santos to find and kill Freddy during the mission OG Loc. CJ states, Ain't this Vagos' hood?."
 VLA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Varrios Los Aztecas have been around since the early 1980s, and are one of the more recently formed gangs in Los Santos. Much of their origins and past history is unknown. It is highly likely that they evolved from the El Corona neighborhood, and their presence grew with the increase of Mexican and other Hispanic/Latino immigration to the area, correlating with the relative deprivation of the area compared to the rest of the city."
 RHB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Rollin' Heights Ballas are based in Jefferson, and also control eastern Willowfield and northern East Los Santos. Since the Ballas were probably formed in Glen Park or Jefferson, it is likely they were one of the original sets of Ballas. The RHB is the second-largest Ballas set, behind the Front Yard Ballas."
 KTB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kilo Tray Ballas are based in Glen Park, and also control the western part of Willowfield. Since the Ballas were probably formed in Glen Park or Jefferson, it is likely they were one of the original sets of Ballas. However, they are not as powerful as other sets, specifically the Front Yard and Rollin' Heights."
 SBF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Seville Boulevard Families are based in the district of Playa del Seville. The set's origins are unknown, however it is likely they were already around in 1987. They split allegiance with the Grove Street Families and Temple Drive Families sometime between 1987 and 1992, as CJ reveals in the mission Nines and AKs that he doesn't know about the estrangement between the two factions, until Big Smoke explains it to him."

 zakupka:0 "Purchase of weapons"
 zakupka_desc:0 "Gangs can't produce weapons, so they have to get out of it somehow. Equipment can be obtained in various ways, but the most popular was the purchase of weapons from other gangs. For example, the Ballas made a deal with the Russian mafia. At the same time Grove Street Families robbed an army warehouse."

 police.1.t:0 "Bad rumors"
 police.1.d:0 "We have heard rumors that the lack of funding this year is due to the reluctance of the cabinet rats from the City Hall to transfer money to us. Moreover, some individuals in narrow circles do not hide it, it is possible that the money has settled in someone's pockets."
 police.1.a:0 "Just a rumor"

 police.3.t:0 "Introduction"
 police.3.d:0 "On our shoulders lies the task of maintaining order and protecting our citizens. In the city well so rampant crime, which we have to fight. But we are bound by the decisions of the City Hall."

 police.4.t:0 "End of the roundup"

 police.5.a:0 "We're leaving"
 police.6.t:0 "Holy shit! COPS!"
 police.6.d:0 "The cops raided the place on our streets. The police often patrol the area, so we can't fight now. They can't go on like this forever, they must soon run out of steam. We think that in a month they will be gone."
 police.6.a:0 "We sit at home and drink beer"
 police.7.t:0 "Denunciation"
 police.7.d:0 "Jimmy Hernandez, a police officer and member of the C.R.A.S.H unit, described in detail the frauds and crimes committed by Frank Tenpenny. He other members of the unit are extremely corrupt people who use their knowledge of gangs to stop and force them to hand over some of their profits and supplies to them, regularly commit acts of police brutality, making them almost like a gang, but with the power of law enforcement. Despite his proclamations that he was against any gang formations in the city, Tenpenny worked well with the Ballas gang, as the leaders did not object to the distribution of crack, a particularly heavy drug. The Ballas, in turn, were not above using crack as a weapon to destroy other gangs by distributing the drug to their members. Tenpenny and his partner Eddie Pulaski shot their colleague Ralph Pendelbury because they feared exposure from him. Tenpenny officially threatens Carl Jhonson to do his work or he'll frame him for Officer Pendelbury's murder, whom Tenpenny kill merely ten minutes before Carl's return to Los Santos. \nNo there is a problem, the fact is that it is not possible to check this information."
 police.7.a:0 "This is interesting, we need to dig further"
 police.7.b:0 "It's a good story, but there's no truth in it"
 police.8.t:0 "Assault on police officers"
 police.8.d:0 "Today, unknown assailants attacked a car with three policemen. The attackers shot the police and fled the scene. We know that three police officers harassed a girl and two men from this area. They probably turned to some street gang for help. Of course, this trio got what they deserved, but this does not mean that it is the right thing to do. We must urgently cancel the super-powers of the police and investigate this incident."
 police.8.a:0 "Fuck!"
